# Numbers in python consist of integers and floats

# Integers are whole numbers and floats (meaning floating point decimal) are decimal point numbers
# performing any operation with a whole number and a float will always return a float value
# dividing numbers (even integers) will also always result in a float

# Underscores in Numbers:
# if you want to break up large integers visually, you can do so with underscores rather an commas and python will ignore them

# Multiple Assignment: 
# You can assign many values to more than one variable in a single like of code to shorten your code.
# It is common to do this when initializing a set of numbers
# x,y,z=0,0,0

# Constants:
# Constants are variables whose value stays the same for the whole program. Other programming languages have built in constant types, but in python 
# you just have to indicate a variable isn't meant to change by useing all capital letters in the variable name
# MAX_CONNECTIONS=500
