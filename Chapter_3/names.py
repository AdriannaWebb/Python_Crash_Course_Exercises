'''
3-1. Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a list 
called names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, 
one at a time.
'''

names = ['Kait','Amaya','Kellie','Caleb']

print(names[0])
print(names[1])
print(names[2])
print(names[3])

'''
3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of 
just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each 
message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the 
person’s name.
